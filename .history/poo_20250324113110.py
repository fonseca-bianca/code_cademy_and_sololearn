In programming, there is a paradigm that follows the same
principle as blueprints and instances. It's called OOP. In
OOP, blueprints are referred to as classes and instances
are known as objects.

In the real world, everything has distinguishing characteristics:
a dog has its breed, color and name; a car has its brand, model
and color. In programming, classes and objects mirror this concept 
with attributes. Those are the properties that define an object's
individuality within a class.
