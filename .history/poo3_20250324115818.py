"""
The main difference between FUNCTIONS and METHODS is that 
FUNCTIONS are independent and can be called on their own, 
while METHODS are associated with a class and can be called 
only with its instance. This means that you can't call a 
methods without having the instance of a class where that 
method is defined

# print() = function
# my_car.fonk(): method #fonk = buzinar

"""
Everything in Python, including FUNCTIONS, is a Object.
For instance, integers are instances of the 'int' class, and
functions are instances of the function classe, among others.
This OOP nature underlies Python's flexibility and power
