"""
The filter() function, just like the map() function, takes in
a function and an iterable as arguments. The key purpose of 
filter() is to apply a condition specified in the provided 
function to each item in the iterable and return only those 
for which the function evaluates to True.

This code filters and returns products with names 4 characters
long.
"""

products = ["table", "sofa", "cushion", "bookshelf", "vase"]

# filter products with name length equal to 4:
filtered_prod = list(filter(lambda name: len(name) == 4, products))
